I. Packages
1. When you installed the plugin, a Packages category was automatically created
and is selected by default to display in the Choose Package Page.
If you want a different category to do this, select the desired category
under the Package Category field in Package Settings.

4. When you're done creating packages, go back to the package settings page
and drag packages from the Available Packages column to Your Active Packages
column to build the Choose Package page.  You can rearrange packages in the
Your Active Packages column to change the order they're displayed.

1. Go to the widgets section on your Wordpress Dashboard
2. Add the WooCommerce Cart Totals widget to your sidebar.
3. It is also recommended that you add the WooCommerce Cart Widget under the
WooCommerce Cart Totals.

1. The Step-By-Step is located under the Step-By-Step tab in the Step-By-Step
Ordering settings
2. Create product categories. Each page in the ordering process will display
one parent category, which will include their child categories.
3. To create child categories, make a new category and select the parent
category under the Parent field.
4. Go to the Step-By-Step settings page and drag categories into Your Ordering
Process.  You can rearrange the categories inside to change the order.

IV. Options and Fees (optional)

1. This is an optional page you can create that displays products in a table
rather than a catalog.
2. A product category named Options and Fees was automatically created on
install.  This category is the default for the Options and Fees page.
3. If you wish a different category to serve this role go the Options and Fees
settings page and select the category you want and save.
4. Create child categories of the chosen Options and Fees category, and make
products belonging to those categories.
5. Drag and drop child categories from Available Categories to Options and Fees
Page Outline to build your Options and Fees page.

V. WordPress Themes
This plugin is configured to work with themes already compatible with
WooCommerce.  While the plugin is fully functional with these themes out of the
box, it is recommended to take these steps if you are using one of the
following themes:

--Twenty Sixteen--
It is recommended that a full-width template be used on the Choose Package
page.  Since Twenty Sixteen does not come with a full-width template, download
a child theme from our website, install it, then activate it.  Go to the package
selection page in the Admin settings and choose the Full Width template on the
right-hand sidebar.

--Twenty Seventeen--
Twenty Seventeen does not come with a sidebar.  Download a child theme from our
website, install it, then activate it.  Go to the Ordering page in WP Admin and
choose the Page with Sidebar template on the right-hand sidebar.

--Divi--
The Choose Package and Checkout page works best on a full-width template.
The Step-By-Step Ordering page should be used on a 3/4 and 1/4 width template
for main content and sidebar, respectively.

--Storefront--
The Choose Package page is best displayed on the Full width template, which
you can select when you edit that page on the right-hand sidebar.  The default
template is recommended for the Ordering page.

== Uninstalling ==
If you wish to disable this plugin's functionality you can deactivate it in
the plugin settings.  If you wish to completely remove this plugin, deactivate
it, then click the Delete button.

By default all settings, custom fields, and custom metas are not deleted
on uninstall.  If you wish to remove all Step-By-Step data, add this line to
your wp-config.php file:

define( 'SBS_REMOVE_ALL_DATA', true );

This will delete any content created by the Step-By-Step plugin, including
the Package and Step-By-Step Ordering pages, all settings, and post metas.
Products and Categories will not be removed.
