= V. WordPress Themes =

This plugin is configured to work with themes already compatible with
WooCommerce.  While the plugin is fully functional with these themes out of the
box, it is recommended to take these steps if you are using one of the
following themes:

** Twenty Sixteen **
It is recommended that a full-width template be used on the Choose Package
page.  Since Twenty Sixteen does not come with a full-width template, download
a child theme from our website, install it, then activate it.  Go to the package
selection page in the Admin settings and choose the Full Width template on the
right-hand sidebar.

Download the child theme [here](http://stepbystepsys.com).

** Twenty Seventeen **

Twenty Seventeen does not come with a sidebar.  Download a child theme from our
website, install it, then activate it.  Go to the Ordering page in WP Admin and
choose the Page with Sidebar template on the right-hand sidebar.

Download the child theme [here](http://stepbystepsys.com).

** Divi **

The Choose Package and Checkout page works best on a full-width template.
The Step-By-Step Ordering page should be used on a 3/4 and 1/4 width template
for main content and sidebar, respectively.

It is strongly recommended that a child theme be used, as core template CSS
needs to be modified to optimize the UI.  You can download our custom Divi
child theme here.

Download the child theme [here](http://stepbystepsys.com).

** Storefront **

The Choose Package page is best displayed on the Full width template, which
you can select when you edit that page on the right-hand sidebar.  The default
template is recommended for the Ordering page.

= Step-By-Step Premium Upgrade =

If you like our plugin and would like to see more content from us please
consider purchasing a license from us.  Premium users get additional features
like unlimited steps, navigation options, required products, either-or products,
package store credit, preset themes, and much more! You will also have access to
our support team!

After purchasing a license, a key will be sent to your provided email.  Enter
this key into the input box in the Premium tab in the Step-By-Step Ordering
settings and then click Activate.

= Uninstalling =

If you wish to disable this plugin's functionality you can deactivate it in
the plugin settings.  If you wish to completely remove this plugin, deactivate
it, then click the Delete button.

By default all settings, custom fields, and custom metas are not deleted
on uninstall.  If you wish to remove all Step-By-Step data, add this line to
your wp-config.php file:

`define( 'SBS_REMOVE_ALL_DATA', true );`

This will delete any content created by the Step-By-Step plugin, including
the Package and Step-By-Step Ordering pages, all settings, and post metas.
